The Watchers is a Survival/Horror game that is planned to be released in March of 2016.

I am creating the game both as my Senior capstone, and also as a large project that I can put my name on. 
I choose this project because I wanted to focus on the AI of the enemies, as I think that what makes a horror game is the unpredictability. 

The concept of the game is that after a car crash, a man (the player) wakes to find his children are missing. Tracking the footprints in the snow, the man follows his children into the strange forest that surrounds Moonlight-Lake Cemetery.
The Forest is decorated with statues of children, but the man notices movement in the statues whenever he looks away. As the man gets closer to the scared cries of his son, the statues get more and more active, trying to close in on the man. 
After the man finds his son, he must put him on his shoulders and try to get back out of the woods, if he can...
